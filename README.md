## About me
**The structure of the web has always interested me**. I had worked in the security sector for a couple of years when I made the decision to shift careers in 2019. Prior to beginning my higher vocational education, I had no knowledge of programming, frontend, backend, or fullstack roles. Three years later, my degree is now complete, and my journey has only just begun.

**Since then I haven't stopped learning and creating.**
